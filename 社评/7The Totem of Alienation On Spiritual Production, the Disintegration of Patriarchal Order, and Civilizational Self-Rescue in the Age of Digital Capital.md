**The Totem of Alienation: On Spiritual Production, the Disintegration of Patriarchal Order, and Civilizational Self-Rescue in the Age of Digital Capital**

Streetlamps are festering sores of the metropolis, oozing thick, yellow light that sticks to the faces of young people, smeared like palettes. Wigs are plastic vines, skirts are waterfalls of data. They hold up selfie sticks like spiritual banners, twisting their waists before altars programmed by algorithms. Behind security windows, an elderly man coughs, phlegm mixed with shrapnel from seventy years ago: "Degenerates! Forget your roots!" The voice disperses through the double-paned glass—it is no match for the electronic moans of virtual idols from phone speakers. This is not a generation gap; it is the collective mutation of the human sensory system following the rupture of a mode of production. When the blood-kin network of rural China is dismembered by reinforced concrete, when the "alienation of man" prophesied by Capital is pushed to a new dimension by digital technology, these painted and powdered youths are precisely the bizarre flowers blossoming from the wound of history.

In the 1844 Manuscripts, Marx inscribed his diagnosis: "The worker only feels like a human being in the exercise of his animal functions." Today, this diagnosis has been rewritten by algorithms—the youth only feel like "themselves" when consuming virtual symbols. Observe the "gacha" mechanism—is it not the cybernetic mutation of surplus value exploitation? What you pay is not money, but your youthful time, squeezed dry by the 996 work schedule; what you gain is not use-value, but the "dopamine pulse" designed by planners using behavioral psychology. The "differential mode of association" depicted by Fei Xiaotong in From the Soil is reconstructed in cyberspace as a "differential mode of association based on traffic": the frequency of your data exchange with the central server determines your proximity in the digital clan. Those "top donors" who lavish fortunes on virtual streamers—are they not the "clan chiefs" of the digital age? Only, what they offer sacrifices to is not ancestral tablets, but strings of code within a server.

Yet the cost of this self-rescue is staggeringly high. It is quietly undermining the very foundation of a civilization. When we speak of the "cultural infiltration" of Japanese and Korean ACG, its terror lies not in the art style, but in the colonization of narrative logic. Observe the most popular anime and games—what is their core? It is extreme individual heroism, a worship of "bonds" detached from history and society, an aesthetic trap that romanticizes sacrifice and nihilizes responsibility. It does not directly negate family and nation, yet it makes you feel that "family" is a burden; it does not openly mock dedication, yet it makes you feel that "the collective" is laughable; it does not oppose childbearing, yet it portrays having children as a self-negating, ignorant choice. Over time, the emotional structure of a generation is reshaped: they feel alienated by Zhuge Liang's "utter devotion," yet can weep over an anime character's "tragic death"; they are baffled by the profound meaning of "Yue Fei's mother tattooing him," yet are enthralled by plots of "destroying the world for the one I love." Is this merely a matter of cultural preference? This is a fissure in civilizational memory, a cancerous mutation in the system of meaning. When the spiritual totems of a nation's youth are no longer Shennong tasting herbs, Yu the Great controlling floods, or Su Wu herding sheep, but instead become foreign warriors, mages, and virtual idols, the roots of culture have already begun to loosen in silence.

An even deeper trap lies behind those flickering screens. Capital grins, needing neither guns nor spies. It merely needs to type code, letting algorithms, like bloodthirsty mosquitoes, precisely target every point of human vulnerability. You are lonely? It pushes "fictosexuality" at you. You are anxious? It feeds you the "philosophy of lying flat." You are angry? It incites you to join in "inter-circle brawling." It slices, packages, and auctions off your attention, domesticating your emotions into conditioned reflexes—liking, forwarding, recharging, tipping. Platforms are no longer platforms, but digital enclosures for penning in the spirit; entertainment is no longer entertainment, but a sensory assembly line for paralyzing the will. The "peaceful evolution" once warned against by older revolutionaries has now been upgraded: it does not force you to change your stance, it merely immerses you in endless entertainment, comparison, and fragmented information, gradually eroding your capacity for thought, your will to resist, and your instincts for procreation and inheritance. What it produces is not enemies, but hollow people. These people are outwardly glamorous, keen consumers, conversant with all internet memes, yet they feel deep alienation and fatigue towards real-world responsibilities, family maintenance, community building, and the nation's future. They resemble the "beautiful mice" in the "Universe 25" experiment—in a "utopia" of extreme food and water abundance, they only groom themselves, avoid social interaction, and refuse to mate, ultimately leading to the extinction of the entire population. Is our society, within the "abundant enclosure" constructed by capital, also staging a slow, magnificent civilizational suicide?

The numbers form a silent stele, inscribed with a wordless epitaph: China's total fertility rate has fallen below 1.0, and the natural population growth rate has turned negative—meaning the population size of each generation will be halved; simultaneously, China's online gaming market exceeds 300 billion yuan, the daily peak for live-stream tipping surpasses 1 billion yuan, and spending on ACG peripheral goods grows over 40 percent annually. The dialectic of these figures is stark and clear: the inflation of the virtual economy and the shrinkage of population reproduction are not accidental opposites, but two sides of the same coin under the logic of capital accumulation. When housing, education, and healthcare are financialized to extract exorbitant profits, the cost of labor force reproduction is pushed to an unbearable weight for individuals; at this point, capital conveniently provides cheap virtual substitutes, using "cybernetic pacifiers" to soothe the dispossessed generation, completing the final link in the cycle of exploitation. This is precisely a digital upgrade of Marx's theory of the "relative surplus population" in Capital: it creates not only an industrial reserve army, but also a "meaning reserve army"—a group of "beautiful mouse"-like youths who attain illusory satisfaction in the virtual world, thereby abandoning struggle, procreation, and resistance in the real world.

Calhoun's "Universe 25" experiment is now being reenacted on a civilizational scale. In that 2.7-meter-square enclosure divided into 16 rooms, after peaking at 2,200 mice on day 315, the population irreversibly descended into "behavioral sink": the "beautiful mice" males only groomed, females attacked their pups, the social structure completely disintegrated, and extinction arrived amidst abundance. The terrifying revelation of this experiment is: when a creature is stripped of all survival challenges and social roles, left with only pure consumption and sensory stimulation, its reproductive instincts and social capabilities will degenerate by themselves. Today's East Asian societies—Japan's "hikikomori" exceeding one million, South Korea's world-lowest fertility rate of 0.72, China's popular discourse of "lying flat" and "social anxiety"—are these not a human version of the "Universe 25" preview? When housing prices become the ultimate barrier, when the "996" work schedule drains youth, when the education arms race burdens families with debt, when "unemployment at 35" looms like the sword of Damocles, is the youth's rational choice to "not marry, not have children, not struggle" not precisely a vote with their feet, an exit from this "abundant enclosure" alienated by capital?

Some prescribe "cultural nationalism" as the remedy, advocating for reviving tradition and resisting Western influences. But this is like using the clan ethics of From the Soil to counter global capitalism—the "rule by ritual" described by Fei Xiaotong is as fragile as paper before the "governance by algorithms" of transnational capital. The root of the problem lies not in the cultural surface, but in the deep cancerous mutation within the relations of production. When platform capital possesses social mobilization and ideological shaping capabilities far exceeding any feudal clan, when data becomes a more critical means of production than land or machinery, any cultural revival detached from the economic base is doomed to be a feeble performance art. The youth do not lack love for this land, but when they discover that following the ancient maxim of "plowing and reading to sustain the family" might only yield the inability to afford even a single bathroom in a first-tier city after three generations' savings, escaping to the virtual world becomes the most rational "irrational choice."

The true way out requires a "social anatomy" oriented toward the digital age, using the scalpel of Marxism to dissect the gaudy epidermis of this "Brave New World."

First, we must confront that "digital alienation" has become a new form of capital exploitation. In Capital, Marx revealed that capital exploits the worker's surplus value by owning the means of production. Today, the core means of production owned by platform capital are data and attention. Every swipe, like, and search we perform produces valuable training data for capital; every second of our immersion contributes attention surplus value for advertisers. The youth's "free choice" in the virtual world is actually "forced consumption" precisely guided by algorithms. To break this deadlock, data property rights must be liberated from capital monopoly. Just as in the past we had "land to the tiller," we must now achieve "data rights to the producer"—allowing every data producer, that is, every netizen, the right to share in the benefits generated from data, and the right to determine how personal data is used. This is not just an issue of economic distribution, but the fundamental basis for breaking the identity of "digital tenant farmer" and rebuilding the dignity of labor.

Second, we must reconstruct the public nature and ethics of "digital patriarchal order" in virtual space. From the Soil reveals that the stability of traditional society relied on the ethical order under the "differential mode of association." Today, blood and territorial communities have disintegrated, but we can absolutely construct a "new differential mode of association" in the digital world—digital communities based on shared values and cultural identity. These should not be fan hierarchies ranked by traffic, but genuine "digital homelands" founded on knowledge contribution, skill sharing, and mutual cooperation. The state should lead the construction of open, public-interest digital platforms, allowing the classics, art, and philosophy of Chinese civilization to be inherited and innovated in vibrant forms, so that youth need not be forced to accept the "narrative colonization" of foreign cultures within the algorithmic cages of commercial platforms.

Finally, the value evaluation system for "labor" must be reshaped, breaking the distorted opposition between the virtual and physical economies. When game streamers earn millions daily while scientists, teachers, and workers have meager incomes; when property speculators and crypto-traders get rich overnight while diligent laborers cannot afford a home—this inversion of values inevitably drives youth towards virtual speculation rather than physical creation. We must use comprehensive measures including taxation, policy, and honor systems to return labor value to its proper place, making commitment to the physical economy, technological innovation, and cultural creation a respected and rewarding path.

For five thousand years, this land has endured darkness deeper than today's. But each rebirth has relied on confronting fundamental contradictions and innovating institutions. From the collapse of the well-field system to Shang Yang's reforms, from aristocratic clans to the imperial examination system, every civilizational leap was a revolutionary restructuring of old production relations. Today, standing on the threshold of the digital age, what we need is not moral judgment on the youth's makeup, but a profound revolution against the production relations of digital capitalism.

If not, history may record this most silent of extinctions: no flames of war, no famine—only the last generation, weeping in their VR headsets within the metaverse over the epic end of some virtual civilization, while the real civilization they inhabit—the one that gave birth to the Book of Songs, the Records of the Grand Historian, Dream of the Red Chamber, the one that traversed the Long March, survived the War of Resistance, and initiated reform—has long since completed its complete euthanasia, from spirit to bloodline, amidst the revelry of likes and swipes. The streets remain bustling, data continues to grow, screens still flicker. Only that civilizational heartbeat, which once surged for five millennia, will finally dissolve into the endless stream of algorithmic recommendations, becoming a faint sigh heard by none.

The long night is not yet over, the path is narrow and the forest deep. That warning bell hanging in the dome of history is striking the conscience of our generation with the rhythm of Calhoun's rat colony's extinction. Will we be the "beautiful mice" grooming before the mirror in "Universe 25," or will we be the "new pioneers" who smash the data cage and rebuild a spiritual homeland on the digital wilderness? This choice lies not in palace memorials, not in academic papers, but in each one of you and me—whether we still dare, amidst the overwhelming silence of the traffic feast, to retain that last piercing clarity; whether we are still willing, on the edge of the abyss of nihilism, to utter for this civilization the first hoarse yet genuine—cry.
